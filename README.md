  ### PFD-ASG
## Problem Statement: How can we make (OCBC) online banking more accessible for everyone.
## Target Audience : Individuals with Autism and Learning Disabilities

Main problem : 
1. Autistic may have difficulty understanding and interacting with the UI and features of the main OCBC app.
2. Autistic may have difficulty managing and signing up for an OCBC account
3. Persons with Learning disabilities may have trouble understanding the application's features and functions and may take a longer time to understand financial banking applications.
4. Persons with Learning disabilities may have trouble understanding certain UI (eg. Icons, displayed details, interactive features)
5. Our main goal is to improve the user experience and allow certain minority groups to be able to easily access banking applications instead of constantly going to phsycial locations when not needed.
6. ### We want to reduce the number of people going to the physical branches which may cause overcrowding as the opening of accounts can be done online but it is a very time consuming process.
7. ### Why are some people preferring to go to the physcial branches instead of signing up online instead.

# Update 1.0 (Initial problem solution)
We have a normal account that the caretaker already has. The account is linked with the dependents account - link dependents account with caretaker's current account, instead of a separate new account.
If caretaker doesn't have an account, a new caretaker account will be created with all the normal user features.
sign up problem solution : when creating an account can choose disability - if autism is chosen, the caretaker setting up the account can link the current bank account to the dependent. 
SINGPASS api to make identification and signing up easier. Many banking apps are using singpass to authenticate for better security.
# Update 2.0 (The confirmed final solution)
1. For servere ASD cases, we keep the original solution from update 1.0 of the caretaker assistance in helping servere ASD cases to sign up
2. We keep the singpass sign up and facial reconginition login and submission of some pdf documents to open a special account for servere.
3. ### Main solution we want to simulate the signing up process from physcial branches to online.
4. We create a sort of step by step process with an interactive narrative model AI that will assist in the signing up process online for the user
5. User can click on a 'Chat w me' button like how most website have a text based interactive model but we make it with a microphone and a voice response and form filled assistance to help with the sign up process.
6. After certain steps completed in the sign up process, tutorials will also be issued  (gamification to help users understand application itself)
7. We keep the tutorial idea in main application too.
8. For visualisation, refer to the wireframe.
